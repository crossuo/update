<br>Welcome to CrossUO, the very first Ultima Online clientwith <b>real native multiplatform support</b>,
<br>
<br>This is the first release of a new client, so expect issues. We need to release this so you can
<br>help us with testing and getting the project in shape to go forward.
<br>There is zero new features since the last Orion release, do not expect much. Minor updates will follow
<br>until we consider this stable enough to start fixing known Orion bugs and new features.
<br>
<br>Be patient and report any issues. Thank you!
<br>
