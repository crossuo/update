    <br>Welcome to CrossUO, the very first Ultima Online client with <b>real native multiplatform support</b>.
    <br>
    <br>This is the first release of a new client, so expect issues. We need to release this so you can help us with testing and getting the project in shape going forward.
    <br>There is zero new features since the last Orion release, do not expect much. Minor updates will follow until we consider this stable enough to start fixing known Orion bugs and new features.
    <br>
    <br>Be patient and report any issues. Thank you!
    <br>
